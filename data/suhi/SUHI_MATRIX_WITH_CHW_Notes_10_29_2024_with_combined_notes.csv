I informed the patient that the state sends letters to SNAP beneficiaries, and they have to reply for them to keep their benefits. He said he has yet to receive any mail from the state. I gave pt the number of the Illinois Department of Human Services number 800-843-6154, to call and find out why he stopped receiving benefits.  Pt also wanted assistance with utility bill payments. I gave him the number of the Latino Organization of the Southwest, and I told him they could also help him with his SNAP benefits., I called pt, and he said he misplaced the information I gave him, so I gave the patient again the information of the Latino Organization of the southwest at 4051 W 62nd St, phone 773-581-1900., I spoke with the patient, who stated that we were ok. I asked pt if he had called the Latino Organization of the Southwest. He said he hadn't. He said he lost the number. I gave the patient the number and address once more."

I will contact the patient as soon as I schedule an appointment., I called Access @ Holy Cross to schedule an appt for Mr. Evans to see Dr. DeUrrutia. Unfortunately, the first opening in that clinic with any provider is January 31. I set the appointment for 1:00 PM. I will call the patient later to notify him., I noticed that pt had been readmitted to HCH, so I decided to go and see him in the hospital. The patient stated he was having breathing problems and decided to call the ambulance. I informed the patient of his appointment with Dr. De Urrtia on Jan. 31. I called the office to try to get something sooner, but there were no openings with any provider. So Pt was placed on the waiting list., I spoke with the patient; he has gone to the ED on three occasions and was admitted to HCH twice. He stated that he was doing ok. I reminded him of his upcoming visit on Tuesday, January 31, with his PCP, Dr. DeUrrutia. I reiterated the importance of seeing his doctor to prevent frequent visits to the ED. Pt expressed understanding."

The patient expressed that his hand pain prevented him from working or doing anything. He also mentioned that he wanted to apply for SNAP benefits. When I offered the number to apply for benefits, he questioned how he would make the call with his hand hurting. I reminded him that he was speaking to me on the phone and could make the call. I then directed him to the website abe.illinois.gov to apply for benefits online., During the conversation with the patient, he confirmed that he underwent the hand surgery as planned. He shared that the surgery was successful, and he was scheduled to begin physical therapy next week. The patient expressed frustration over being unable to work, and I advised him to focus on his physical therapy, which will enable him to return to work soon.
